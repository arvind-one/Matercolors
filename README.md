# MaterColor

A tiny, zero-dependency libary for building harmonious material palettes for any color. This library is reverse-engineered from Google's Official Inline Color Tool.

## The Need

While tools exist for generating material palettes such as mbitson's mcg, the colors are approximated based on the Old Material Color System introduced around 2014. While edelstone reverse-engineered the tool helped save a lot of time in understanding the core functionality, the generated palettes could only be accessed through the interface, much like the original tool. Hence the need for a library that tries to offer the same, and more.
